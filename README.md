Hello, I'm r4isy. Today I wrote a Discord bot that grants roles to users based on their status.
All you need to do is enter your role ID and the token of your bot in main.py.
Don't forget to change the .gg/kenucheck link on line 21 of the code to something you want your users to enter their status with.

Then all you have to do is run the start.bat file and sit back. 

Good luck.
